## Discriminative-Kalman-Filter
This code contains scripts (and data) necessary to reproduce the reported results for Burkhart, Brandman, Franco, Hochberg, & Harrison's "The Discriminative Kalman Filter for Bayesian Filtering
with Nonlinear and Nongaussian Observation Models."

Matlab code was run in an environment fully described using the ```ver``` command and documented in [environment_matlab.txt](./environment_matlab.txt). The LSTM results were run in a conda environment as specified in [environment.yml](./environment.yml).  

*The code is provided under the GNU v3.0 public license: we encourage you to adapt this code to filter your own data!*
